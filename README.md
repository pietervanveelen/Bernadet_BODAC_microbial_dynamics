### Two-year seasonal dynamics of BODAC filter biofilm communities

This is repository contains the analysis of microbial communities comprising biofilms in Biological Oxygen-Dosed Activated Carbon. The dataset describes the temporal dynamics of microbial communities in roughly bimonthly collected samples of BODAC and backwash water in an UltraPureWater factory in Emmen.
Water purification performance of two consecutively placed BODAC filters demonstrates a remarkable system performance stability of 12 years, without replacement of activated carbon. Regular backwashing of the filters is responsible for prevention of saturation, while subsequent regeneration of microbial biofilms with hypothesized stable composition facilitates remarkable efficiency in water purification without downstream reverse osmosis membrane fouling in the system. Here we investigated the seasonal regeneration and allegedly stable biofilm community composition in BODAC filters and backwash water.
Input data were created by sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons using primers 515F and 926R on Illumina Miseq (300 bp PE). Fastq sequence files were analysed using QIIME2 (scripts can be found in the scripts/QIIME2/ directory) and the feature table, taxonomic assignments, phylogeny and metadata were imported into R (in input_data/). The [SILVA database v.132](https://www.arb-silva.de/documentation/release-138/) was used as reference data for taxonomic assignments. This analysis will be submitted as **Bernadet et al. (in prep)** "url DOI" titled *Two-year temporal dynamics of biofilm microbial communities colonizing granules within Biological Oxygen-dosed Activated Carbon (BODAC) filters*.
